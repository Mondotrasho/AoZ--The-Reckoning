AoZ the reckoning devlog

things to add
-terminal flash red on damage
-make each question and user input whipe previous user input similar to how '/r' works at the end of a cout << "blah blah" << '/r' 
-make table of responses so I can write up a text doc with generic failure messages and it randomly picks a line
